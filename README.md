# Awesome AiFi Ecosystem Map

**Definition of AiFi:** AiFi (Artificial Intelligence Finance, pronounced “A-I-fye”) brings AI assets—such as GPUs, models, data, and IP—onchain by leveraging composable, decentralized infrastructure (e.g., DeFi). By tokenizing these underutilized resources into tradable digital commodities, AiFi unlocks liquidity, broadens investor access, and opens new financing pathways—ultimately catalyzing capital flows and innovation across the AI ecosystem. (Note: AiFi does not imply fully commoditizing core IP or entire models, but rather enabling new financial mechanisms around AI-related resources and rights.)

Contributors fundraise in a fair launch, and the DAO invests the raised SOL into DeFi or yield farms. Liquidity is permanently locked, ensuring holders can trade any time, while tokens can be redeemed against the DAO’s SOL at expiration.                                                                                                                                        | DAOS.fun aims to lower barriers for collective investments, featuring a fair launch, locked liquidity, and transparent redemption. It simplifies forming on-chain DAOs or “funds,” bridging memecoin enthusiasm and serious DeFi strategies.                 | <ul><li>Fundraise Window (1-week, same token price for all)</li><li>AMM with Permanently Locked Liquidity</li><li>DAO Wallet (investing SOL in yield farms or DeFi protocols)</li><li>Governance Modules (Q4 2024–Q1 2025)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                            | <ul><li>Locked Liquidity</li><li>Transparent Fundraising</li><li>Creator Verification</li><li>Refunds If Target Fails</li><li>Partial Redemption (proportional share if market cap > initial raise)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [daos.fun](https://www.daos.fun/)                             |
| **Spectral**    | Spectral combines AI inference and blockchain infra to power autonomous on-chain agents. It employs a decentralized Machine Intelligence Network and zero-knowledge proofs for model verification, serving DeFi/Web3 with trust-minimized AI. A revenue-sharing model and community governance encourage data scientists & agent creators to contribute.                                                                                                                                            | Spectral envisions an accessible Agent Economy where anyone can spin up autonomous agents (24/7) on-chain.
